GAME 4: Clicks in 10 seconds
This game consists in measuring the number of clicks you can make in a 10 second period.

Phase 1
The game will have a start button that you will have to press before starting the game. Then, once the button is pressed and the game begins, you will have to create a timer to stop the game after 10 seconds have passed since the “Start game” button was pressed.
Once the game has started, you will also have to count the number of clicks that you make on a box on the screen.
Once the 10 seconds have passed, the game ends and stops counting the number of clicks on the box and displays the result to the user.
Phase 2
In this phase the “Click here” box should move around the screen to a random position after each click and should change the size of the box.
