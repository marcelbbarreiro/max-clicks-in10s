GAME 4: Clicks in 10 seconds
This game consists in measuring the number of clicks you can make in a 10 second period.

# Phase 1
The game will have a start button that you will have to press before starting the game. Then, once the button is pressed and the game begins, you will have to create a timer to stop the game after 10 seconds have passed since the “Start game” button was pressed.
Once the game has started, you will also have to count the number of clicks that you make on a box on the screen.
Once the 10 seconds have passed, the game ends and stops counting the number of clicks on the box and displays the result to the user.
Phase 2
In this phase the “Click here” box should move around the screen to a random position after each click and should change the size of the box.
Extra Steps
Possibility to play with mouse click or spacebar. (Different user scores)
Improve the design such that it is designed using a mobile-first strategy and responsive
Wireframe example
The user should be able to choose their username and look through other user results.

# Requirements
You must use only one HTML file to develop this game, this means that you must hide and show dynamic elements without reloading the page.
Before starting the game, you must enter your username on the screen to start the game.
The ranking of the players who have played a game
Must always be visible on screen
Refreshing the page will lose the information stored in the ranking, since the information must be stored in JS variables
When a player enters his username and clicks on the start button, the player must be added to the ranking with the message "Currently playing ..."
When this player finishes the game, the ranking will be dynamically updated to show your score instead of the previous message
When the player finishes the game, the Scoring screen will be displayed with the results of the game.
All game processes must be carried out without reloading the page
You will not be able to use cookies, only localStorage for saving score data
You must store:
Current game
User name
Game duration
Scoring of the current game
Ranking
User name
Scoring
The ranking will show above the last record that has been entered
After each game the total score is stored (if you refresh the browser is lost)
You cannot use third-party libraries
You must use Git for the development of the project and branches for each feature, try not to separate branches by person
4. Deliverables
To evaluate the project you will need the following deliverables:

Repository with the code that includes also the documentation bellow
A presentation in Google Slides explaining:
Explain what lessons you’ve learned during this project
How have you decided to organize the three stages of the game that you have had to develop?
